Usage:

On startup, Impressive will display a black screen with the program logo at the center. If caching is enabled, but background rendering is disabled, all pages of the presentation will then be rendered once. A bar in the lower half of the screen displays the progress of this operation. Any key (except for Q and Esc) or mouse click skips this process, with the effect that Impressive will render the remaining pages on demand. Please note that the overview page will not be complete until every page has been rendered at least once. In other words, if the precaching process was skipped, placeholders will be displayed for all pages that have not been rendered yet. By default, Impressive will build up the cache in the background while the presentation runs. Thus, the progress bar will not appear and the preparation will only take the amount of time required to render the first two pages of the presentation.
After this initialization process, Impressive will switch to the first page directly and without any transition. The following keyboard and mouse operations are available from this moment on:

Q key or Esc key
  Quit Impressive immediately.
LMB (left mouse button), Page Down key, Cursor Down key, Cursor Right key or Spacebar
  Go to the next page (using a transition).
RMB (right mouse button), Page Up key, Cursor Up key, Cursor Left key or Backspace key
  Go to the previous page (using a transition).
Home key / End key
  Go directly to the first or last page of the presentation.
L key
  Return to the last (most recently displayed) page. This can be used to toggle back and forth between two pages.
F key
  Toggle fullscreen mode. Unfortunately, this does not work on Windows systems.
Tab key or MMB (middle mouse button)
  Zoom back to the overview page. While in overview mode, a page can be selected with the mouse and activated with the left mouse button. The right or middle mouse button or the Tab key leave overview mode without changing the current page.
LMB over a PDF hyperlink
  Jump to the page referenced by the hyperlink. Two types of hyperlinks are supported: Links that point to some other page of the same document, and URL hyperlinks like Web links and e-mail addresses. This feature is only available if pdftk is installed. Furthermore, xdg-open from the freedesktop.org Portland project is required for URL links on non-Win32 platforms. Please note that the hyperlink feature will not work properly when pages are rotated.
click&drag with LMB (left mouse button)
  Create a new highlight box. While at least one highlight box is defined on the current page, the page itself will be shown in a darker and blurry rendition. Only the highlight boxes will be displayed in their original lightness and sharpness.
  if a page with highlight boxes is left, the boxes will be saved and restored the next time this page is shown again.
RMB (right mouse button) over a highlight box
  If the right mouse button is clicked while the mouse cursor is above a highlight box, the box will be removed. If the last box on a page is removed, the page will turn bright and sharp again.
S key
  Save the info script associated with the current presentation. The main purpose for this is to permanently save highlight boxes or keyboard shortcuts, so they will be restored the next time this presentation is started.
T key
  Activate or deactivate the time display at the upper-right corner of the screen. If the timer is activated while the very first page of the presentation is shown, it activates »time tracking» mode. In this mode, a report of all pages visited with their display duration, enter and leave times will be written to standard output. This can be very useful when preparing presentations.
R key
  Reset the presentation timer.
Return key or Enter key
  Toggle spotlight mode. In this mode, the page is darkened in the same way as if highlight boxes are present, but instead of (or in addition to) the boxes, a circular “spotlight” will be shown around the mouse cursor position, following every motion of the mouse cursor.
+ key / – key or mouse wheel
  Adjust the spotlight radius.
Z key
  Toggle zoom mode. When this key is first pressed, the current page will zoom in. The page will be displayed at double size, but in its original resolution (i.e. it will be blurry). Impressive will re-render the page at the new resolution if the graphics hardware supports it. During this time, Impressive will not accept any input, so don't even think about clicking the mouse or pressing keys before the image gets crisp again.
  In zoom mode, all other functions will work as normal. Any operations that leave the current page, such as flipping the page or entering  the overview screen, will leave zoom mode, too.
[ / ] key
  Adjust the gamma value of the display (might not be supported on every hardware).
{ / } key
  Adjust the black level of the display (might not be supported on every hardware).
\ key
  Revert gamma and black level back to normal.
O key
  This will toggle the »visible on overview page« flag of the current page. The result will not be visible immediately, but it can be saved to the info script (using the S key) and will be in effect the next time the presentation is started.
I key
  This will toggle the skip flag of the current page. A page marked as skipped will not be reachable with the normal forward/backward navigation keys.
B key / W key
  Fade to black or white, respectively. This feature can be used if a whiteboard or blackboard in front of the projection area is to be used during the presentation. Using these two keys, the screen will fade into a solid color. On any keypress or mouse click, it will fade back to normal. These keys are not available in overview mode.
click&drag with RMB (right mouse button) in zoom mode
  Move the visible part of the page in zoom mode.
Cursor keys in overview mode
  Navigate through pages.
Alt+Tab keys
  Leaves fullscreen mode on Unix-like systems to facilitate task switching while running full-screen presentations.

Any other alphanumeric (A-z, 0-9) or function key (F1-F12) can be used to assign shortcuts to pages that require quick access. If one of the keys is pressed together with Shift, the currently displayed page is associated with this key. To recall the page later, it is sufficient to press the shortcut key again. Shortcuts can be permanently stored with the S key.
